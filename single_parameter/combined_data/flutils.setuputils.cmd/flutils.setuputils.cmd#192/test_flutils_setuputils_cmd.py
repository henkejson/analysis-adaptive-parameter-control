Warning:: For projects where startup time is critical, this function\n        allows for potentially minimizing the cost of loading a module if it\n        is never used. For projects where startup time is not essential then\n        use of this function is heavily discouraged due to error messages\n        created during loading being postponed and thus occurring out of\n        context.\n\n    Examples:\n\n        >>> from flutils.moduleutils import lazy_import_module\n        >>> module = lazy_import_module('mymodule')\n\n        Relative import:\n\n        >>> module = lazy_import_module('.mysubmodule', package='mymodule')\n    "
